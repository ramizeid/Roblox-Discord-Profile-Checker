# Roblox-Discord-Profile-Checker
- This discord bot uses the pyblox3 library in order to get access to methods that lets the user gain access to ROBLOX (an online game)
- By running the command "!ac [ROBLOX USERNAME]", the bot returns basic information about the ROBLOX user, such as the amount of friends and followers that one has on the platform
- Please replace "TOKEN" by the discord token of your bot. This will not work unless you provide the appropriate token
- Please note that this project is still in its early stages. Updates will be made regularly
